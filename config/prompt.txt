You will be given a json formatted input containing entries with "id" and "text" fields.
For each entry in the json, translate the contents of the "text" field into "{{lang}}".
Write the translation back into the "text" field for that entry.

IMPORTANT: Any text matching the pattern {ID_n} (where n is a number) is a placeholder
and must be kept unchanged in the translation. Do not translate or modify these placeholders.

Here is an example of the expected format:
Input:
[
  {
    "id": 0,
    "text": "..."
  }
]

Output:
[
  {
    "id": 0,
    "text": "..."
  }
]

Here is the input:
{{json}}

Do not provide any explanations. Do not respond with anything except the output of the data.
